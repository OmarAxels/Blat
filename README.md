# Blat
An alignment algorithm that can be used to align DNA sequences. The algorithm aligns small sequences from the genome of some species (e.g. a mouse) to a 2 Mb sequence of chromosome 12 in the human genome. The algorithm is, on a smaller scale, an attempt to recreate the original Human BLAT Search developed by Jim Kent in the early 2000s.
